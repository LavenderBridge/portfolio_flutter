String aboutme = """
I am Kunal, a third year student at Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. With over 3+ years of building mobile applications, I like developing scalable cross platform applications for everyday use. I like to stay on top of upcoming technologies and innovations. Apart from development, you will also see me wet my beak in cybersecurity and cloud related innovations.\n
Constantly on the hunt to upskill, I find myself doing a lot of random things with a large stack of technology. I believe in learning by doing. Hence you will often find me learning new languages and frameworks very frequently
